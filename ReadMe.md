#This Is Our Second  Task At Object Oriented 
## A Task Deals With The Development Of A Weighted ,Deiliberate Graph Data Structure 
 directed graph (or digraph) is a graph that is made up of a set of vertices connected by edges.

#Methods On Graph:
*Add Or Remove Vertics To The Graph
*Add Or Remove Edges To The Graph.
*Connnect Between Two Vertics.
*copy -Compute a deep copy of this graph.
#Graph Algorithims:
*isConnected:Checking If there is a valid path from EVREY node to each
other node. NOTE: assume directional graph - a valid path (a-->b) does NOT imply a valid path (b-->a).
*ShortestPath:check the length of the shortest path between src to dest while src is the strat vertex and dest is the end vertex, and return the Road Of Path In list of node_data.
